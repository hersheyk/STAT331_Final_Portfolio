## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
library(readxl) 
library(tidyverse)

military <- read_xlsx(here::here("supporting_artifacts",
                                    "Activities",
                                 "Practice_Activity_Military", 
                                 "gov_spending_per_capita.xlsx"), 
                      sheet = "Share of Govt. spending", 
                      skip = 6, 
                      n_max = 192)

military_clean <- military |> 
  mutate(across(.cols = everything(), .fns = ~na_if(., "xxx")),
         across(.cols = everything(), .fns = ~na_if(., ". .")),
         across(.cols = "1988" : "2019", .fns = ~as.numeric(.)))
  
```

You can add options to executable code like this

cont_region

```{r}
cont_region <- read_xlsx(here::here("supporting_artifacts",
                                    "Activities",
                                 "Practice_Activity_Military", 
                                 "gov_spending_per_capita.xlsx"), 
                      sheet = "Regional totals", 
                      skip = 14) |> 
  filter(Region != "World total (including Iraq)", 
         Region != "World total (excluding Iraq)")


```

military_clean

```{r}
 military_clean <- military_clean |> 
  anti_join(cont_region, 
                   by = c("Country" = "Region")) 

```

```{r}
military_clean[5, 1]
military_clean[53, 1]
military_clean[80, 1]
military_clean[160, 1]
```

```{r}
military_vertical <-  military_clean |> 
  pivot_longer(cols = c("1988":"2018"), 
               names_to = "Year",
               values_to = "Spending" )

ggplot(data = military_vertical, 
       mapping = aes(x = Spending, y = Year)) +
  geom_boxplot()

```
