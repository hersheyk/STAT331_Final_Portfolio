I have demonstrated an understanding of learning targets R-1, R-2, DVS-2, DVS-3, WD-2,  and PE-1. I think I have begun to demonstrate an understanding of the learning targets WD-1, WD-3, and DVS-3. I have submitted revisions whenever they were necessary to the best of my ability which I believe demonstrates my commitment to continued learning. I have done more than one Challenge option when given a chance for Challenge #2.

One goal I\'ve fulfilled, which might seem a given for most people, but can be difficult for me sometimes, is that I have gone to every Stat 331 class. I had a lot of difficulty doing this with classes last quarter and struggled with motivation, but I have gone to every single class, so I am proud of myself.  As a team member, I\'ve grown more comfortable with my classmates and feel no hesitation in texting them if I have a question or answering others\' questions. We call to do work together outside of class sometimes. 

Regarding the timelines for projects, I often submit them after canvas due dates but before grading deadlines. They usually are only a couple of hours late. I appreciate the soft deadlines as I can better organize my time concerning my other classwork, which have stricter deadlines. I make sure to review and read the preview coursework before class. While sometimes it is after 8 am, it is often submitted before 12. However, I believe I submitted two of the Preview Activities relatively late.

Thus far, I deserve an A minus because while I am doing well independently, I should be doing better regarding my peer review deadlines and putting more effort into submitting assignments precisely on time.
